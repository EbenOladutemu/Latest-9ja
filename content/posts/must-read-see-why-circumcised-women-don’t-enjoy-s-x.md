### **Dr Esther Somefun, a Gender and Reproductive Health Analyst, has stated that it was difficult for women who have undergone Female Genital Mutilation to enjoy sex.**

In her explanation, Somefun described FGM, widely known as female circumcision, as the partial or total removal of female external genitalia due to non-medical reasons.

> “Due to the complications of FGM, women find it difficult to enjoy sex because the external female organ, the clitoris which ensure lubrication during sex has been cut off,” Somefun told NAN on Sunday.
>
> “These women can also experience painful sex, infertility, pelvic inflammatory infections, menstrual pains and keloids.
>
> “FGM can also cause obstructed labour due to the narrowing of the external genitalia. Women with type two and three FGM are most at risk during child birth.”

The expert said lubricants can be used but it will not totally resolve the pain experienced during sex.

She disclosed that corrective surgery can be done to open the female genitalia to allow for easy passage of the male genitals.

> “There is no risk of gynecological problems including painful menstruation, no repeated pelvic infections or problems of infertility and urinary tract infections.
>
> “Sexual intercourse will not be painful and there is no risk of obstructed labour.”

Somefun urged those experiencing FGM complications to see a gynecologist, while advising parents and girls to join the advocacy against the act.
